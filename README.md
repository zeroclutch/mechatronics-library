# Mechatronics

The software for a Whac-a-mole robot project created for a university mechatronics course. The goal of the project was to create a robot that can knock four coins into a basket and smack some moles by driving to them and hitting them. My group was able to achieve a rate of a 1 mole every 4.2 seconds, and won the class competition.
